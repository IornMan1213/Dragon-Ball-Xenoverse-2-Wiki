### 2026-09-22 cycle update — canonical endpoint alias/granularity bridge
- [x] Inspected the active cross-link contract plus equipment/accessory and DLC identity artifacts before adding a new bridge.
- [x] Added `docs/data/pq-endpoint-alias-granularity-map.json` as a deterministic presentation/identity bridge. It explicitly separates canonical identity from source/display naming and DLC bundle-vs-pack granularity.
- [x] Added two equipment conflict records (PQ152 Ranger Wig wording; PQ155 Gamma 2 Helmet wording) without merging canonical entities or inventing an alias.
- [x] Added six deterministic DLC granularity mappings covering PQ101-120: broad `Super Pass` presentation → individual `Super Pack 1-4` / `Extra Pack 1-2` canonical requirements. These mappings are explicitly one-to-one by PQ range and do not add canonical edges.
- [x] Validated every bridge canonical target against `docs/data/pq-reward-relationships.json`: **0 missing canonical target references**; canonical relationship count remains exactly **860**.
- [x] Updated `docs/data/CROSS-LINK-CONTRACT.md` so downstream navigation can consume the bridge without treating it as canonical relationship data.
- [ ] Exact next task: use the bridge to audit/repair downstream PQ ↔ equipment/accessory/DLC reverse navigation and page/index references, preserving canonical IDs and source provenance while reporting unresolved identities rather than guessing.

### 2026-09-22 cycle update — downstream PQ endpoint navigation audit
- [x] Audited the canonical PQ equipment/accessory reverse projections against the canonical equipment/accessory identity layer.
- [x] Confirmed current reverse integrity: equipment 125 forward edges / 123 unique target endpoints; accessory projection 28 / 28; **0 missing reverse endpoints, 0 orphan endpoints, 0 PQ-set mismatches**.
- [x] Added `docs/data/pq-endpoint-navigation-audit.json` documenting exact navigation resolution for the known PQ152/PQ155 naming conflicts without merging canonical entities.
- [x] Registered the navigation audit and alias/granularity bridge in `docs/data/pq-cross-domain-index.json`.
- [x] Preserved canonical distinctions: `Android 17 (DB Super) Wig` → `acc-065`, `Android 17 (DB Super) Ranger Wig` → `equip-059`, `Gamma 2's Helmet` → `acc-067`, and `Gamma 2 Helmet` → `equip-062`.
- [ ] Next gate: extend endpoint identity-resolution auditing to skill, Super Soul, character, and DLC navigation, then add automated validation requiring every canonical endpoint to resolve exactly or be explicitly classified as conflict/granularity.
