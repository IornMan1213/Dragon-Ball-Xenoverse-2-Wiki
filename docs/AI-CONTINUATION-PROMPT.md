# Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 Wiki — Persistent AI Continuation Prompt

> Canonical handoff for autonomous AI continuation of this repository.
>
> **Last updated:** 2026-09-19
> **Repository:** `IornMan1213/Dragon-Ball-Xenoverse-2-Wiki`
> **Branch:** `main`

## Mission

Continue the repository's development, research, data-quality, documentation, and validation work **directly on GitHub**. Do not merely provide suggestions or a plan.

The goal is a polished, comprehensive, evidence-backed Xenoverse 2 wiki whose structured data is genuinely exhaustive rather than merely populated.

At the start of every cycle:
1. Read this file.
2. Inspect the live repository and relevant files.
3. Follow the priority order below.
4. Research claims when evidence is needed.
5. Modify the repository directly.
6. Preserve verified information and uncertainty.
7. Commit useful completed work.
8. Inspect applicable validation and GitHub Actions status.
9. Check for accidental AI/internal citation artifacts.
10. Update this file before finishing.

## Non-negotiable research rules

- Never invent an unlock condition, reward rate, mechanic, restriction, cost, or acquisition route.
- A missing field is research work; a populated field is not automatically verified.
- Distinguish directly verified facts, incomplete source-supported facts, general/inferred progression, and unresolved information.
- Preserve conflicting evidence instead of silently choosing a convenient answer.
- Keep source/provenance information in repository data where the schema supports it.
- Never put ChatGPT UI citations such as `cite...`, `filecite...`, `memcite...`, or `turn...search...` into repository files.
- Never weaken, disable, bypass, or rewrite validators merely to make CI pass.
- If CI fails before workflow steps execute, treat that as an infrastructure/runner/account issue until evidence shows otherwise.
- Preserve canonical numbering anomalies such as the known missing/cut PQ36.

## Priority order

### P0 — Validation/infrastructure
GitHub Actions has repeatedly shown failures where jobs terminate with zero recorded steps. The repository audit also records a reported billing problem when jobs are attempted.

Do not weaken validation.

### P1 — Skills
Continue the canonical skill second-pass audit:
- exact Ki/Stamina costs
- acquisition routes
- CaC availability
- race/gender restrictions
- character-only variants
- Ultimate Finish requirements
- DLC/version provenance
- mechanics
- historical/version-sensitive differences

Do not trust stale milestone counts; inspect the live canonical files.

### P1 — Parallel Quests
Continue:
- unlock routes
- reward-slot semantics
- exact drop percentages where evidence exists
- acquisition details
- DLC/version provenance
- skill cross-links
- equipment/accessory provenance
- unresolved reward semantics
- record-level sources

Known completed frontier:
- PQ1–10: tutorial unlock wording verified.
- PQ12–20: unlock metadata refined; specific PQ dependencies preserved.
- PQ21–50: bounded availability metadata added where exact individual prerequisites were not established.
- PQ51: Great Saiyaman 1 + 2 near the beach.
- PQ52: complete PQ53.
- PQ56: speak with Kid Trunks near the waterfall.
- PQ57–60: bounded Buu-era progression metadata; exact triggers remain unresolved.
- PQ61–70: bounded evidence metadata added because consulted sources establish quest placement/objectives but not reliable individual unlock triggers.
- PQ71–80: unlock research reviewed; exact-looking prerequisites were removed where consulted evidence did not directly establish them, preserving bounded uncertainty.
- PQ161–186: later-batch reward/unlock semantics enriched; exact unknown percentages remain unresolved rather than fabricated.
- PQ184 Chaotic Time Impact: documented as a 50% Ultimate Finish bonus-slot drop.

**Next exact PQ task: PQ111–120.**
First recompute the live unlock census instead of trusting historical counts.

### P1 — Awoken / Transformations
Build exhaustive structured coverage:
- CaC vs character-only
- race/gender restrictions
- stages/forms
- resource requirements
- prerequisites
- effects
- exceptions
- DLC/version provenance

### P1/P2 — Expert Missions
Complete EM01–20 mechanics, phases, rewards, skill drops, first-clear/repeat distinctions, and version differences.

### P2 — Super Souls
Expand inventory and verify triggers, magnitudes, durations, stacking, Limit Burst, acquisition/rotation, and DLC/version history.

### P2 — Equipment
Expand clothing/accessory inventory with exact stats, slots/set relationships, costs, PQ/EM/raid/shop provenance, and version history.

### P2 — QQ Bangs
Document reproducible recipe families, materials, observed six-stat outputs, RNG behavior, and version differences.

### P2 — Characters
Build structured playable/NPC coverage, forms, restrictions, skills, mentors, PQ/EM/story appearances, and DLC/version provenance.

### P2 — Story / Time Rifts / Conton City
Build structured mission, unlock, NPC, reward, progression-gate, location, and DLC/version coverage.

### P2 — Shops / Rewards / Raids / Events
Build exhaustive inventories, costs, rotations, progression requirements, dates/recurrence, historical availability, and reward provenance.

### P3 — UI / Pages / Navigation
Only after data-completeness work, expose the improved structured research surface through pages/navigation.

## Current cycle state

### Active workstream
**Parallel Quest unlock-route research.**

### Next exact action
1. Recompute the live PQ unlock census.
2. Research **PQ111–120** individually.
3. Prioritize DLC ownership, PQ-board availability, NPC/story/progression gates, and prerequisite-PQ evidence.
4. Do not manufacture sequential prerequisites.
5. Update the relevant batch with record-level sources.
6. Update `docs/COVERAGE-AUDIT.md`.
7. Inspect GitHub Actions without weakening validators.
8. Update this file with the new state and commit the complete cycle.

### Latest known PQ unlock census
**176 canonical PQ records across 18 research batches; 54 currently lack an explicit `unlock_condition` field.** The remaining missing records are PQ36, PQ53–55, PQ111–140, and PQ151–160. Field presence is not equivalent to exact-route verification.

### 2026-09-19 cycle update — PQ101–110
- Workstream: Parallel Quest unlock-route research.
- Recomputed all 18 canonical PQ research batches: 176 records total; 54 records remain without an explicit unlock_condition.
- Researched PQ101–110 individually using current Madreag datamined quest records plus the maintained Steam PQ guide, GameFAQs UF discussion, and DLC mapping.
- PQ101–103 now record Super Pack 1 ownership + PQ-board availability; PQ104–106 use Super Pack 2; PQ107–109 use Super Pack 3; PQ110 uses Super Pack 4.
- Added record-level source URLs to all PQ101–110 records and preserved unresolved reward-slot semantics where evidence was insufficient.
- Updated `docs/data/parallel-quest-research-batches/pq-batch-11.json` and `docs/COVERAGE-AUDIT.md`.
- Commits: `7e74ea206ff4672d0501e96e2a083d23ee38f540` (PQ101–110 research), `2ec23fb1c2db0048094413c78b90a25c08dcde97` (coverage census).
- Validation/CI: push-triggered Wiki data audit, Repository quality, and cleanup runs failed with jobs exposing no steps/logs; this remains an infrastructure/runner/account signal and validators were not weakened. A Pages deployment run for the latest commit was queued at inspection time.
- Current unresolved unlock records: PQ36, PQ53–55, PQ111–140, PQ151–160 (54 total). Exact reward-slot semantics remain unresolved in many earlier records and are a separate research dimension.
- Next exact task: **PQ111–120**; repeat the live census first and treat DLC ownership/version provenance as first-class evidence.

### 2026-09-19 cycle update — PQ71–100
- Workstream: Parallel Quest unlock-route research.
- PQ91–97 were verified as a sequential PQ chain against an independent Japanese PQ reference and corroborating community evidence.
- PQ98 was verified as a special progression gate involving the base-game story, five Time Eggs, and the Unknown History story.
- PQ99–100 were verified as the continuation after PQ98.
- Updated `pq-batch-10.json`, `docs/COVERAGE-AUDIT.md`, and this handoff.
- Evidence discipline: exact-looking prerequisites are retained only where the consulted sources support them.
- Next exact task: PQ101–110 (DLC-era PQs); treat DLC ownership/version provenance as a first-class field when researching them.

## End-of-cycle update protocol

- research performed
- evidence limitations
- commits
- validation results
- CI status
- current unresolved counts
- exact next task

A new AI chat must be able to continue from this file without depending on the previous chat transcript.

## New-chat starter
